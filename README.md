# Reduced-rank mean estimation for Projective-resampling Informative Predictor Subspace
Since the projective-resampling approach replaces the multivariate response by its one-dimensional linear projection to the regression, which is totally random and so not informative to the regression at all. 
This is why it requires large numbers of resampling to estimate the projective-resampling Informative predictor subspace well.
To reduce the number of resampling dramatically but still to keep the same estimation accuracy, in this paper, we newly consider a linear projection of Y through various response dimension reduction methodologies.
It turns out that this new projection at least does not cost the loss of information on E(Y|X).
